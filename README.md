# Bayesian-workshop
 Notes, data, and R notebook for an introductory workshop on Bayesian
 inference 
 
 I compiled these notes for a series of three, one-hour workshops
 introducing Bayesian inference to the Donovan-Burke lab group at the
 University of Georgia. The data set is a cleaned and condensed
 version of one that Kristen Nolting collected for her PhD
 dissertation.
